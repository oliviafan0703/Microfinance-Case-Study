# Explaining Loan Default in Microfinance
Data Science Project: Default on Microfinance Loans

Microfinance is the provision of banking services to individuals excluded from traditional credit markets, typically due to a lack of collateral. The goal of microfinance is to enable low-income individuals to undertake small investments towards starting or improving a business in hopes. Kiva is a San Francisco based microfinance institution that connects online lenders to entrepreneurs in 77 countries following the peer-to-peer lending model. While Kiva operates as a nonprofit and aims to “expand financial access to help underserved communities thrive,” default (nonrepayment of loans) threatens both the sustainability of Kiva’s charitable enterprise and the stability of the lives Kiva aims to improve.

The Kiva 2012 database provides a collection of information on a random sample of loans provided from 2005-2012, which can be used to explore the factors influencing loan default.
